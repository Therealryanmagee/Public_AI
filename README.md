I'm a average person, in my living room sitting at my PC, not a person at a huge office with 15 team members. I have a job (that has nothing to do with coding) that I go to everyday. I have kids, and bills, and.. life. I like coding, and Python, I LOVE machine learning. I have a little mini dream of one day just miraculously having the inspiration firehose out of my fingertips, but that's a dream. Unless you have a team, you're probably not going to be very productive. That brings us to this point; we may not have a office or a huge team, but we have GitHub, by George.. if you see this and its empty, I'm going to attempt to get a frame erected, Ill make a Reddit to recruit, i'm looking for a team that is willing to take this for what it is, an experiment, a learning experience, and fun.
